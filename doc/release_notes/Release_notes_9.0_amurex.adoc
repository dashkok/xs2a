== Adjusted OAuth flow

From now on, OAUTH flow is a part of REDIRECT approach which configured modes (`common.scaRedirectFlow` property in ASPSP profile):

* REDIRECT - usual redirect mode
* OAUTH - integrated OAuth mode (TPP asks for token after initiation of request)
* OAUTH_PRE_STEP - pre-step OAuth mode (TPP asks for token before initiation of request)

There was a link `scaOAuth` which was replaced by `scaRedirect` in responses. SCA approach OAUTH was removed.
