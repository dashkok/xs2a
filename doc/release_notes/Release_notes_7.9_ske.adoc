* Added possibility to accept URL encoded certificates

== Added possibility to accept URL encoded certificates
From now on, the header `tpp-qwac-certificate` can be URL encoded and will still be
interpreted correctly.

This may be useful if the used gateway, which forwards the requests to the XS2A-Service, performs a URL
encoding on the sent certificate.
